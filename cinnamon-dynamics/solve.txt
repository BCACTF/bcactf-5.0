The service is vulnerable to the SHA-256 length extension attack. For all
the preloaded scripts, we know the value of the token:
T = SHA-256(secret || script)

Applying the length extension attack allows finding the value of T':
T' = SHA-256(secret || script || attacker_data)

All the attacker needs to know to find T' is the value of script and the
length of secret || script. Of course, the attacker knows the length of
the script, but the length of the secret is not provided---this has to
be found by brute force (it's not that long so it this is quick).

Because attacker_data is malicious data appended to the end of the script,
it can be used to run arbitrary code on the server. The attacker can use
this code added to the end of the script to read and print flag.txt.

Also, since attacker_data is prepended by some binary padding the attacker
should use the preloaded script named "Unfinished Script", which ends in a
comment. This allows the binary padding to be commented out and not cause
errors; the actual payload should start with \n so it is not commented out.
