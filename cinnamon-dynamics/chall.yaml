  Cinnamon Dynamics, an innovative technology company, provides a service
  for the public to execute short scripts to query some limited information
  about the company. To combat abuse, they've instated a requirement for
  all scripts to be approved by a company employee before they can be
  executed. Approved scripts are granted a "script token" that allows
  them to be executed an indefinite amount of times, so long as the script
  is not modified. Unfortunately, it seems that malicious actors have
  managed to circumvent the security system...
