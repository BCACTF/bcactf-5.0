  You will receive a series of random PNG images in Base64 form.
  Each image contains some number of non-overlapping rectangles.

  Your task is to determine the color, position, and size of each
  rectangle in the image.

  Responses should be provided in the following format:

  `R,G,B,X,Y,W,H; R,G,B,X,Y,W,H; R,G,B,X,Y,W,H; ...`

  R, G, and B refer to the RGB color of the rectangle.
  X and Y denote the position of the rectangle.
  W and H are the width and height of the rectangle.

  Note that each piece of information for each rectangle should be
  separated only by a comma, but each rectangle is to be separated
  by a semicolon and a space.

  (0, 0) refers to the top left corner of the image.

  The order of rectangles in the response does not matter.
  That is to say, the following two responses are equivalent:
  1. `246,217,230,235,181,55,36; 101,212,140,78,336,27,34`
  2. `101,212,140,78,336,27,34; 246,217,230,235,181,55,36`

  The order of the information for each rectangle must not be
  changed. The following two responses are not the same:
  1. `246,217,230,235,181,55,36; 101,212,140,78,336,27,34`
  2. `217,246,230,235,181,55,36; 101,212,140,78,336,27,34`

  Suppose an image has the following two rectangles:
  1. RGB: (125, 48, 45); X: 12; Y: 127; Width: 51; Height: 15
  2. RGB: (65, 48, 132); X: 424; Y: 115; Width: 16; Height: 21

  Either of these answers would be accepted:
  1. `125,48,45,12,127,51,15; 65,48,132,424,115,16,21`
  2. `65,48,132,424,115,16,21; 125,48,45,12,127,51,15`

  But neither of these answers would be accepted:
  1. `125, 48, 45, 12, 127, 51, 15; 65, 48, 132, 424, 115, 16, 21`
  2. `125,48,45,12,127,51,15;65,48,132,424,115,16,21`

  There will be ten total images for which you must ascertain these
  details. You will have one minute to complete all ten tasks.

  The image will always be well-formed and will only contain
  non-overlapping rectangles on a white background.

  For further details about the expected response format, refer to
  the sample image and the associated answer.
