- Come up with an idea and put it on the Google Sheet. Make sure there isn't already a similar challenge.
- Create your challenge and a `chall.yaml` file. See [CHALL_YAML_GUIDE.md](/CHALL_YAML_GUIDE.md) for more information.
- Make sure to include a solvepath, and/or any scripts you used yourself to make/solve the challenge.
- Add a `Dockerfile` (if needed). Look at other similar challenges from previous CTFs as a guide. If you need help ask an admin.
- Create a branch, name it in the format of `category/chall-name`.
