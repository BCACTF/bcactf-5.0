  I was trying to sign into this website, but now it's
  asking me for a phone number. The way I'm supposed to
  input it is strange. Can you help me sign in?

  My phone number is 1234567890
hints:
  - If only you could just type in the phone number
  - Have you heard of event listeners in Javascript?
