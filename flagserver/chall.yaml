  It looks like Ircus have been using a fully exposed application
  to access their flags! Look at this traffic I captured. 
  I can't seem to get it to work, though... can you help me
  get the flag for this very challenge?
hints:
  - It looks like their server contains flags for two challenges -
    this one and a decoy one.
