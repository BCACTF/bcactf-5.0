Suggested solutions:
1. Identify the extremely wide highway (Ontario Highway 401).
For example, searching for "18-lane highway" or even just
"wide highway near airport" can lead you towards the correct
location. The building is the Mississauga Harley-Davidson,
which has what3words ///beeline.tape.couch.

2. Careful manipulation of the image (such as by viewing it
in a program that can properly view 360-degree photos and
cropping) can yield something that Yandex Reverse Image Search
can recognize. Alternatively, search for something like
"white tram bridge europe" to find other images of the bridge.

near a wide road (e.g. with https://osm-search.bellingcat.com/).
