  Here are some pictures.

  The flag format will be bcactf{ANS1_ANS2_ANS3}, where:

  - ANS1 is the first word of the what3words code of the
    main Google Maps pin on the circled building in geolocation-1.jpg.
    For example, if it was the Empire State Building (heave.wipes.clay),
    ANS1 would be "heave".
  - ANS2 is the second word of the what3words code of the 
    exact coordinates from the photosphere URL of geolocation-2.jpg.
  - ANS3 is the third word of the what3words code of the 
    exact coordinates from the Street View URL of geolocation-3.png.
