    Help me get an A in Physics! My teacher made this review program for us.
hints:
  - How is the program checking your answer? After all, it's possible to write a correct answer in multiple ways (e.g. x+y vs y+x vs 0+x+y, etc).
  - What information/feedback do you get from each question? How can you use it to your advantage?
