Opening the executable in a decompiler reveals a bunch of
unused functions, each named with a character (like a 
lowercase/uppercase letter or a digit) and whose bodies each
refer to a number from 1 to 20.

Some more digging (perhaps by clicking into some of the variables
like "f" and "B" used in M()) also reveals a number of named
global variables as well, again each with a value between 1 and 20.

Ordering all of these names by their associated values, we get:

1. b
2. c
3. a
4. c__
5. t
6. f
7. leftbrace
8. Five
9. Y
10. m
11. B
12. zero
13. l
14. _
15. n
16. four
17. M
18. e
19. S
20. rightBrace

The flag is bcactf{5Ymb0l_n4MeS}.
