pretty self explanatory...

just scroll through the page and find the images and click on each one
it gives you a hint as to where to find the segments of the flag in the devtools

part 1: html of shark in notFlagPartTrust div
part 2: console of squid
part 3: cookies of clam
part 4: network of shipwreck, response headers of shipwreck
part 5: sources of whale, static then whale.js
final part: go to treasure, navigate to https://_________.___/treasure/robots.txt

piece it together and there you go!

i hope this is easy enough for everyone to do
