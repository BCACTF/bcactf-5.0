Basically realize from the description that
this is transposition cipher using a scytale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale)
and from there you can sort of write code to 
figure out how big the scytale is also I guess
factoring the size of it because 221 = 13 x 17
Or you can just try to brute force transposition it,
there are other ciphers like this so surely some 
website will just crack this as well
