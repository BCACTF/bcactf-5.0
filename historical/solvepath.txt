Basically realize from the description that
this is transposition cipher using a scytale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale)
and from there you can sort of write code to 
figure out how big the scytale is
Or you can just try to brute force transposition it,
there are other ciphers like this so surely some 
website will just crack this as well
