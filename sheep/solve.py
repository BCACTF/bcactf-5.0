# I made this challenge by converting svg
# to GeoJSON on https://labs.mapbox.com/svg-to-geojson/
# converting it into a shapefile in QGIS
# and zeroing out the header.
# Note that generally, just a .shp file is not
# enough to open a shapefile - you also need
# various types of auxiliary indices - but
# the .shp file contains all the polygon data.
