- Look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to create a challenge.

    - Create a new branch for each challenge.
    - Don't commit stuff like `node_modules`, compiled binaries, etc.
    - Include a solvepath.
    - Send a PR and add reviewers/labels.
    - Don't merge your own challs.
