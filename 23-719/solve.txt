Refer to the following articles (as clued by the description/contents/hint):
https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/supreme-court-metadata-sotomayor-trump-dissent.html
https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/supreme-court-accidentally-forgets-to-delete-basic-metadata-in-trump-ballot-ruling/

The hidden text that, in the original PDF, said 
  "SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part",
has been edited to read the flag,
  "bcactf{rEAl_WOrLd_appLIc4t1ons_Of_cTf_ad04cc78601d5da8}".

Several methods can be used to extract this text, such as:
  1. simply copy/pasting, as in the above articles
  2. directly using Ctrl+F in MacOS Preview
  3. using Inspect Element in Firefox's PDF viewer
  4. using a command-line utility like pdftotext.

P.S. Creating this challenge was a bit harder than I expected.
Many PDF editors could not edit (or sometimes even access) the text.
