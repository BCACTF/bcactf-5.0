  theres a demon inside of my head \
  now im unable to go to bed \
  i gave a shout \
  the phone rang out \
  and now theres just feelings of dread

  i picked up the phone and i heard \
  a resounding cry from the herd \
  of phone systems cursed \
  and stuck with the curse \
  of button pressing till theyre dead

  i heard the beeping with my ears \
  knowing it could solve all my fears \
  to find the demon \
  the lemon heathen \
  to wipe away ctf tears
hints:
  - DTMF is a really cool technology
  - There also used to be A, B, C, and D menu selection keys
  - How many keys are there in total? Is it a computer science-y number?
