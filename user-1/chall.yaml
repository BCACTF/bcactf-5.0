  I was working on this website and wanted you to check it out.
  The code is a bit of a mess, since it's only an extremely early version.
  In fact, you're the very first user, with ID 1! 
  
  PLEASE NOTE: What you do should, in theory, not affect other solvers.
  Please contact me if this is not the case.
hints:
  - The form is vulnerable to SQL injection (it uses an UPDATE statement).
  - You will always have user ID 1.
