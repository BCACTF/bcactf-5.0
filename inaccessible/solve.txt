The function win() will print the flag,
but the program just doesn't call it.

You can use a program like gdb to debug
and call the function.

Example:

(gdb) break main 
        (set a breakpoint so that the 
        program doesn't immediately end)
(gdb) run
(gdb) call (int)win()
        (cast win() function to int because gdb doesn't understand its return type)
