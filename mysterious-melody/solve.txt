Each note in the melody corresponds to a hex digit from 0 to F,
as indicated by the scale at the start of the sound file.

Online tools exist to aid with music transcription, but another way
is to view the spectrogram using a tool like Audacity.
(Right click on track, select spectrogram view, and zoom into the right 
frequencies. For convenience, right click and go into spectrogram settings
and change scale to logarithmic to make the spacing better.)

The correct note should now roughly line up with a bright spot in the
spectrogram (and you can add horizontal lines in an image editor to
aid with lining things up) and you can listen to the audio file to
confirm that you are transcribing the correct one.

Then, convert from hex to characters to retrieve the flag.
