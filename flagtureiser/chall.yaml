  Here's a totally normal Minecraft mod (1.19.4, Forge) I've been making, check it out!

  (You do not need Minecraft to solve this challenge)
hints:
  - The name of the mod is a spoof of something else (It is Minecraft related).
  - How does the infected mod jar download Neko Client?
  - Not a hint, just a personal thanks to everyone involved who worked hard in the fight against this malware.
