The .wav file actually contains a pcapng packet trace
(you can find this by e.g. running "strings" on the file,
finding some HTTP requests stuff as well as:
"Dumpcap (Wireshark) 4.2.2 (Git v4.2.2 packaged as 4.2.2-1)"
near the start. Interestingly enough, binwalk doesn't detect it.)
We can retrieve the pcapng by simply deleting the wav header.

This suggests that we should extract the pcapng file and open it
in Wireshark. We see a TCP conversation between 10.0.2.15 and
192.168.178. You can right click any of the TCP packets and
select "Follow > TCP Stream" to see the conversation at once.

It reads:

    hello there host computer 
    hello there vm
    do you know what the flag is
    yeah i think it starts with bcactf{
    ok and the rest of it?
    uhh... listening_ ... i forgot the rest but i have it in an image somewhere, i'll send it to you
    you still there?? it's been a long time
    yeah i'm sorry i'm literally just making the flag on the fly
    port 5500
    ok lemme check it out
    thanks i think i got it hopefully

The first part of the flag is bcactf{listening_. The rest is
supposedly in an image, hosted at port 5500.

Let's find that image. One nice way is to filter by the port,
so that we only see what we need, by typing "tcp.port == 5500"
into the "Apply a display filter..." field at the top of the screen.

We see a few HTTP requests:

0000   52 54 00 12 35 02 08 00 27 1e 36 4a 08 00 45 00   RT..5...'.6J..E.

The response is a HTML file with <img src="rest_of_flag.jpg" alt="1">.

The next request (tcp stream 3) looks like it prematurely reset, so
it likely will not work. 

The response to the next request seems to actually contain the image.
However, the image is large, so it is split into several packets.
One way (which is probably not optimal) that I found to extract the
image is to once again follow the TCP stream. Using "Show Data As Raw",
you can copy the entire response as hexadecimal. Then, we can extract
the image on https://cyberchef.org/ using "From Hex" and "Extract Files".
You can then see the extracted JPEG file, showing "in_a28270fb0dbfd}".
